Welcome to my blog! I am Pritish Chakraborty and I am a CS engineering graduate
who currently works at an ERP startup.

Some of my hobbies are programming, gaming, reading, and hitting the gym - a follower
of Mark Rippetoe's philosophy and workout routines in that area.

I am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Crank7), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/PritishChakraborty08), and
other social networking sites such as Reddit, where I lurk, participate in discussion 
and the propagate the occasional circlejerk.

Here's a picture of me kneeling awkwardly at the office on the occasion of a Diwali 
(an Indian festival) party.

Thanks to Martin Madsen for this Octopress theme - looks awesome and easy on the eyes!
