Welcome to my blog! I am Pritish Chakraborty, a CS engineering graduate
who currently works at ~~an ERP startup~~ a startup in the recruitment space.

Some of my hobbies are programming, gaming, reading, etc.

I am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Crank7), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/PritishChakraborty08), and
other social networking sites such as Reddit, where I lurk, participate in discussion 
and propagate the occasional circlejerk.

Here's a picture of me kneeling awkwardly at the office (in my previous gig)
on the occasion of a Diwali (an Indian festival) party.

Thanks to Martin Madsen for this Octopress theme - looks awesome and is easy on the eyes!
