I currently work with some very talented folks at a startup that specializes in 
~~Enterprise Resource Planning~~ recruitment and hiring.

Our product is built on the Django and Angular tech stack, with uWSGI as production
server.

In my previous (ERP) gig, we built custom solutions using technologies such as Flask and Django,
and used [Tryton](http://www.tryton.org/) as the ORM/backend. 

I've interned earlier with a well-known Indian services company in 2013, and I completed
a project with [SunPy](http://www.sunpy.org) in 2014 for my Google Summer of Code term.

I hang out on the Freenode network with the nick VaticanCameos, and have two 
Stackoverflow accounts - [here](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2147142/uncledolan) 
and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2842216/theredblacktree), admittedly 
not a lot on them!

You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/pritish-chakraborty/46/a62/315) 
as well.
